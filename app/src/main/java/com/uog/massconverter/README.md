### **HomeScreen.kt**
- Provides the **welcome screen** with:
    - A large, friendly introductory message.
    - An interactive button to navigate to the main conversion screen.
    - A visually appealing background and themed content elements.

### **MainScreen.kt**
- Implements the **conversion functionality**:
    - Accepts numeric input for the value to be converted.
    - Allows users to select input and output units through interactive dropdown menus.
    - Displays the converted result with precision, formatted to two decimal places.
- Features **options menu**:
    - Access to the Conversion Guide dialog.
    - Toggle between Light Mode and Dark Mode.

### **Additional Code Highlights**
- **Dropdown Menus**: Interactive dropdowns for selecting units, implemented using Jetpack Composeâ€™s `DropdownMenu`.
- **Conversion Logic**:
    - A centralized function to handle unit conversions using a predefined map of unit-to-meter conversion factors.
    - Converts the input unit to meters and then to the target unit, ensuring precision.
- **Dialogs**:
    - A dedicated **Conversion Guide Dialog** displaying all available units and their conversion factors to meters.
